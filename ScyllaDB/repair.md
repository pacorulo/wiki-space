# Repair
One of the funniest things I've lived is the expression of the eyes of a SQL Administrator when he was advised about the [CAP theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem) that affects to either C\* or Scylla on the consistency side saying "how a database cannot provide consistency?". Well, all is about [Eventual Consistency](https://www.scylladb.com/glossary/eventual-consistency/)(https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/architecture/guarantees.html#eventual-consistency) and here is where repairs have to deal with it.
Repair do exist for consistency reasons but it is related also to tombstones and avoid the resurrection of deleted data (again one awesome doc from `TheLastPickle` about [Tombstones and Cassandra](https://thelastpickle.com/blog/2016/07/27/about-deletes-and-tombstones.html)).
